# AI Agents in Life Sciences: Hands on Session 2 - AI agent collaboration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)


This session provides three different approaches to understanding and implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Structure

### 1. `MCP_scratch/` - Learn MCP from first principles
- Build MCP servers and clients from scratch using Flask and REST APIs
- Understand the underlying JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- Perfect for learning what happens under the hood

### 2. `MCP_python_sdk/` - Production-ready SDK implementation  
- Use the official MCP Python SDK for real-world applications
- Type-safe, protocol-compliant, and production-ready
- Includes advanced features like streaming and sampling

### 3. `existing_clients_and_servers/` - Connect existing MCP hosts
- Examples for connecting to official MCP hosts
- Configuration files and setup guides

## Important

**Don't forget to check your email** for the OpenAI API key we've sent you! You'll need this for the advanced features in both implementations.

## Getting started

1. Start with `MCP_scratch/` to understand the fundamentals
2. Move to `MCP_python_sdk/` for production-ready code
3. Explore `existing_clients_and_servers/` to connect with real AI tools

Each directory contains specific instructions.
