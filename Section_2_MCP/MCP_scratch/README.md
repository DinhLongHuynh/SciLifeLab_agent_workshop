# AI Agents in Life Sciences: Hands-on Session 2 - AI agent collaboration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Welcome! This Jupyter Notebook provides a complete, hands-on guide to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is designed to teach you the fundamentals from first principles, starting with core theory and moving directly into practical, "from-scratch" implementations.

By the end of this notebook, you will have built and tested your own basic and advanced MCP servers and clients using Python, Flask, and REST APIs.

What You'll Learn

This notebook follows a clear learning path to get you up and running with MCP:

Core Concepts: Understand the 3-part architecture (Host, Client, Server) and the two-layer (Data, Transport) design.

Basic Primitives: Learn to implement Resources (read-only data) and Tools (executable functions).

Full Basic Implementation: Combine the primitives to build and run a complete basic_server.py and basic_client.py.

Advanced Features: Explore powerful concepts like Prompts, Streaming, Notifications, and Sampling.

Full Advanced Implementation: Build an advanced_server.py and advanced_client.py that simulates these advanced features.

How to Use This Notebook

Run Sequentially: For the best experience, run the cells in order from top to bottom.

Code Generation: This notebook will create the following files in your directory:
