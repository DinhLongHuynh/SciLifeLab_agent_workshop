# SciLifeLab Workshop: LangGraph AI Agents for Drug Discovery
---

A comprehensive hands-on workshop tutoring participants how to build AI agents using LangGraph, specifically focused on drug discovery applications.

## Workshop Overview

This 75-minute interactive workshop introduces participants to **LangGraph**, a low-level orchestration framework for constructing stateful AI workflows using graphs. Participants will learn to build AI agents that can perform mathematical calculations, search scientific literature, and query drug databases.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:
- Understand core concepts of LangGraph (tools, nodes, edges, state, and memory)
- Create and integrate custom tools for AI agents
- Build a ReAct-style agent from scratch using LLMs and custom tools
- Implement agent memory to maintain conversational context
- Compare custom agents with prebuilt LangGraph agents
- Explore advanced features like error handling and streaming
