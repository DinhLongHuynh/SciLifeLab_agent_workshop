    "Welcome to this hands‑on lab session on building AI agents with **LangGraph**! LangGraph is a low‑level orchestration framework for constructing stateful AI workflows using graphs, where nodes represent units of work and edges define how those units are connected. LangGraph provides several key benefits for agentic AI applications, including durable execution, support for human‑in‑the‑loop workflows, comprehensive memory (both short‑ and long‑term), built‑in debugging, and production‑ready deployment features."
